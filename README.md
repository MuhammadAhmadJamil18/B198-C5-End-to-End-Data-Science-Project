# B198-C8-End-to-End-Data-Science-Project
Project Overview
This project is designed to develop and evaluate a robust movie recommendation system using two primary approaches:

Content-Based Filtering - Recommending movies based on their features.
Collaborative Filtering - Recommending movies based on user-item interactions.
The dataset used is MovieLens 20M, a popular benchmark for recommendation systems, containing 20 million user ratings of movies.

Prerequisites
Before running the code, ensure you have:

A Google account (to access Google Colab).
A stable internet connection (to load datasets and install libraries online).
Step-by-Step Instructions
1. Open the Code in Google Colab
Save the notebook file (.ipynb) to your Google Drive or download it from the source.
Open Google Colab.
Upload the notebook by clicking on File > Upload Notebook and selecting the .ipynb file.
2. Import Libraries
The following Python libraries are required to run the code:

pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
numpy: For numerical computations.
matplotlib and seaborn: For data visualization.
scikit-learn: For machine learning models and metrics.
surprise: A library specifically designed for building and analyzing recommendation systems.
These libraries are imported in the notebook. If a library is not installed, the code will prompt you to install it using !pip install.

Example:
# Install libraries in case they are not available
!pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn surprise
3. Dataset Loading
The MovieLens 20M dataset is loaded directly from an online source. The notebook fetches the data from the following location:

Ratings Dataset: Contains user ratings for movies.
Movies Dataset: Contains metadata like movie titles and genres.
The datasets are loaded using pandas for seamless integration into the code. No manual download is required.

Example:
import pandas as pd

# Load datasets directly from an online source
ratings_url = "http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-20m/ratings.csv"
movies_url = "http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-20m/movies.csv"

# Read data into Pandas DataFrames
ratings = pd.read_csv(ratings_url)
movies = pd.read_csv(movies_url)
4. Data Preprocessing
The following preprocessing steps are performed:

Merging Datasets: Combine ratings and movies datasets for a unified structure.
Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, duplicates, or invalid data points.
Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features like movie genres and user ratings for the recommendation model.
No additional user input is required for preprocessing as it is automated in the notebook.

5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The notebook includes visualization of:

The most popular movie genres.
Distribution of ratings.
User preferences.
Example Code:
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Visualize the distribution of movie genres
movies['genres'].value_counts().head(10).plot(kind='bar')
plt.title('Top 10 Movie Genres')
plt.show()
6. Building the Recommendation Models
Two types of recommendation systems are built in this project:

Content-Based Filtering:

Recommends movies based on metadata like genre, title, or keywords.
Utilizes techniques like TF-IDF to calculate movie similarity.
Example Code:

from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

# TF-IDF Vectorization of movie genres
tfidf = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words='english')
tfidf_matrix = tfidf.fit_transform(movies['genres'])

# Compute cosine similarity
cosine_sim = cosine_similarity(tfidf_matrix, tfidf_matrix)
Collaborative Filtering:

Leverages user-movie interaction data to recommend movies based on similar user behavior.
Implemented using the Surprise library for matrix factorization (e.g., SVD).
Example Code:

from surprise import SVD
from surprise import Dataset
from surprise.model_selection import cross_validate

# Load data into Surprise
data = Dataset.load_from_df(ratings[['userId', 'movieId', 'rating']], reader=Reader())

# Train SVD model
model = SVD()
cross_validate(model, data, measures=['RMSE', 'MAE'], cv=5, verbose=True)
7. Model Evaluation
The models are evaluated using:

Root Mean Square Error (RMSE): Measures prediction accuracy.
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Evaluates error magnitude.
Precision/Recall at K: For ranking performance.
Visualizations compare model performance and highlight strengths of each approach.

8. Running the Notebook
Run the notebook cells sequentially (Shift + Enter).
Ensure that all cells execute without errors. If any errors occur, check the library installation or dataset URL.
9. Results and Recommendations
The notebook generates insights on:

Most popular movie genres and highly-rated movies.
Comparative analysis of content-based and collaborative filtering models.
Key challenges like cold-start and sparsity.
Based on the findings, it recommends:

Hybrid Models: Combining both approaches for better performance.
Deep Learning: Using neural networks for advanced recommendation.
10. Visualization Outputs
The notebook includes multiple visualizations:

Genre popularity (bar plots).
User rating distributions (histograms).
Accuracy comparisons between models (line charts).
All visualizations are automatically generated when the respective cells are executed.

Important Notes
Colab Resources:
Google Colab provides limited resources, such as RAM and GPU availability. For large datasets like MovieLens 20M, it is recommended to use a premium Colab plan if execution speed becomes an issue.

Dataset Privacy:
The MovieLens dataset is for academic and research purposes. Do not use it for commercial projects without proper permissions.

Custom Modifications:
You can easily adapt the code for other datasets or use cases (e.g., books, music, or products) by updating the dataset and preprocessing steps.
